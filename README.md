# University of South Carolina Big Data Student Health Competition
Finished 3rd out of 37 teams solving a case problem where we were asked to determine which patients were healthy and which were not given a large set of gene expression data. Due to time constraints, the code is unorganized but still provided. The presentations for both rounds are also in the repository.
